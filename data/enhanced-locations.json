Established to assert American dominance in the fur-trading industry and secure the Upper Midwest frontier following the Louisiana Purchase. The fort played a crucial role in Minnesota's development and westward expansion. It was essential to Saint Paul's early growth, with the fort's brig serving as the town's first jail. Until the 7th bridge was built in 1880, access from Saint Paul required a cable ferry dating to the 1840s. Lieutenant Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately 100,000 acres from the indigenous Dakota in 1805 to establish the military reservation.",

The Dakota people later used the same site, wrapping bodies in animal skins for burial. The Mdewakanton Dakota lived at the nearby village of Kaposia and considered the area part of Bdóte, their site of creation for their people. Below the mounds was Carver's Cave (Wakan Tipi or 'sacred lodge'), featuring petroglyphs of rattlesnakes and bears cut into sandstone walls.

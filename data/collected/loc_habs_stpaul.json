            "Significance: The significance of the Municipal Hangar was identified in a request for National Register eligibility in 1991.  At that time the Minnesota Historical Society determined the building to be \"eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places as a property associated with the development of the air transportation industry.\"  Only a few airports were established in Minnesota before Wold-Chamberlain in Minneapolis in 1919 and the Saint Paul Airport in 1926.  The hangars built prior to 1927 at Wold-Chamberlain and other airports in the state appear to have been of wood construction, making the Municipal Hangar at the Saint Paul Airport the first steel frame airplane hangar in the state.  Also, according to a survey of state airports in the book \"Minnesota Aviation History: 1857-1845,\" the Municipal Hangar at the Saint Paul Airport appears to be the oldest and most intact airplane hangar in the state.

            "Significance: This log church was originally called the Muskego Church. It was built in 1843 by Peter Jacobson, to serve an early Norwegian colony in what is now Racine, Wisconsin. It is said to be the first Norwegian Lutheran church in the United States. The building is constructed of hewn red oak logs, hand-adzed, with upper logs cupped over ones below. In 1904, the church was moved to the campus of Luther Theological Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. On its removal here it was encased with wood studs and siding. The interior retains the original log finish. Rev. C. L. Clausen was the first pastor. Records shows 130 members in 1845. ",

            "Significance: The Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse is a stunning example of innovative public architecture from the American Depression Era.  Commissioned in 1930, and completed in 1931 by Holabird and Root of Chicago and Ellerbe and Company of Saint Paul, the City Hall design uses two Art Deco styles known as \"American Perpendicular\" and \"Zigzag Moderne.\"  The use of Art Deco styles and incorporation of technologically advanced functional features in the new City Hall building make it a distinctively \"modern\" structure in the context of 1930's architecture.  Art works which symbolically depict the progressive ideals of a modern industrial society add to the futuristic image of the architecture.  Because it was constructed of the highest quality materials and is an excellent representative of a past style in the contemporary built environment, the City Hall is still considered an architectural masterpiece and a landmark in the city of Saint Paul.

The house is of particular interest because it has been altered only slightly from its original condition, and has retained almost all of the original furnishings. ",

            "Significance: Northwest Airlines Hangar and Administration Building was the airline's first corporate headquarters expressly built for that purpose.  Constructed shortly after the company's takeover by St. Paul and Minneapolis interests, the building helped establish the Twin Cities as Northwest's center of operations for more than the next half century.  In its materials, structural engineering, and layout, the building was highly representative of American hangar design during the early years of commercial aviation.  As one of the few remaining examples of its type, Northwest Airlines Hangar and Administration Building was declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in the spring of 1988. ",

            "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are historically significant as the oldest existing railroad complex in Minnesota.  The events leading to the development of railroading in Minnesota and the Northwest; the ambitious career of James J. Hill, the \"Empire Builder\" who founded the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway (now Burlington Northern); and the development of St. Paul as a regional rail and trade center, all focus around the Jackson Street Shops.  The major buildings on the site were built in the 1880s to serve as a base of operations for Hill's railroad and to further his ambitious plans to extend his railroad operations to the West Coast. ",

The shops were built for the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway, precursor of the Great Northern Railway, owned and operated by James J. Hill and are one of the few remaining examples of \"machine shop\" limestone architecture.  The brick chimney served the boiler plant connected to the Machine Shop which provided steam to the original shop complex. ",

            "Significance: In 1979, the Stockyards Exchange Building, including the 1887 building and the 1912/1917 annex, was determined to be of sufficient national significance to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.  The building was nominated for its association with the development of the St. Paul Stockyards which, in the early 1900's, became \"the United States largest stocker, feeder, and milch cow market...\", and also with the development of meat packing in Minnesota which \"supplied dressed meat to a large part of the world.\"  The Stockyards Exchange Building is also recognized for its local significance of having served the community of South Saint Paul as the first Post Office, first meeting place for the City Council, first bank (Stockyards National Bank), and as a meeting place for community groups.  Although the 1887 building is primarily associated with the beginning of these significant developments, the annex additions were constructed by the original business and were the direct result of the increased growth and success of that business.  The annex allowed the business to grow and expand, while remaining in its original location, at a time when the industry reached its peak of production.  The 1887 building and the annex continued to serve the same business until 1977, when reductions in the industry necessitated moving the business to a new smaller building.  Of secondary significance is the recognition of the 1887 building as a fine local example of late 19th Century commercial architecture in Richardsonian Romanesque style, designed by the local architect C.A. Reed, and the recognition of the annex as an example of early 20th Century office building design.  It is also notable that the Stockyard Company remained in the same location for 90 years and that the interiors are relatively unaltered since their construction. ",

            "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are the oldest surviving railroad structures in St. Paul and the oldest structures built for the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway Company in Minnesota.  The shops played an important historic role in the development of St. Paul as a transportation center in the upper midwest.  They were further instrumental in the development of the surrounding communities: Frog Town, Railroad Island, Swede Hollow, the North End and Thomas-Dale.  The oil house was a key part in the operation of the facilities at Jackson Street.  It provided for the storage and handling of the various oils used by the engine, car, paint and shop service buildings.  The oil house was among the original buildings constructed in 1882-83 of grey limestone, using state of the art technology the structure was considered to be substantial and would meet the needs of an expanding railroad for years to come.

Initially they served as repair maintenance shops for the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway and later the Great Northern Railway Company.

            "Significance: The Church of the Assumption was designed by Joseph Reidl (Reidel), Court Architect of the Bavarian ruling family, the Wittelsbechs.  One of the most dominant landmarks in the City of St. Paul, the structure is a simplified and somewhat severe version of the German Romanesque Revival, and is reported to have been patterned after the famous Ludwigskirche (1829-40) in Munich, designed by Friedrich von Geertner (1792-1847).  A view of this Revival Church can be seen in Henry Russell Hitchcock's \"Architecture, Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\" (Baltimore, Md.: Penguin Books, Inc., 1958), Plate 10B. ",

            "Significance: The Arlington Avenue Bridge is significant as an early representative example of a prestressed concrete girder bridge in Minnesota. At the time of construction in 1959, prestressed concrete was emerging as a significant technological advancement in bridge design. at this same time, the Minnesota Highway system was under development and a large number of bridges were required to span and carry the new highway in the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area and throughout the state. The availability and economy of prestressed concrete as a bridge building material facilitated the development of the Interstate Highway system in the Twin Cities and throughout the country by providing the main materials for the construction of a large number of similar bridges in a short time at a very competitive cost. The Arlington Avenue Bridge also represents the development of Elk River Concrete, a regional company that collaborated with the Minnesota Highway Department (MHD) and other engineers to develop a system for prestressed concrete beam fabrication that further facilitated the state's bridge construction and Interstate and highway development during this period.

            "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are a complex of 12 structures.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop was constructed in 1882.  They are gray limestone structures typical of late 19th century \"machine shop\" style industrial buildings.  They are significant as one of St. Paul's oldest known railroad buildings.  They are one of the oldest structures built in Minnesota for James J. Hill's St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company.They are the only surviving buildings from the operating division of the Manitoba Railway.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop are part of the only railroad complex in Minnesota built of stone.  In terms of industry and engineering, they were considered a state-of-the-art facility.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop was designed to function as a major repair facility for freight cars, passenger coaches, and locomotives.  By 1900, the Jackson Street Car Shop and Wood Shop was the Great Northern's major passenger repair facility. ",

            "Significance: As one of the first Montgomery Ward catalog houses built outside Chicago, the property represents a period of expansion and change in the history of the country's first mail-order house.  Conceived as Ward's northwestern branch, the facility housed only a mail-order operation and its associated administrative offices.  Soon after the branch was established, however, competition forced the company to move into the retail field.  Ward's focus increasingly shifted to retail, and the property underwent substantial alterations to accommodate the change.  Montgomery Ward's decision to locate the branch in the Midway District of Saint Paul reflects that area's emergence as a commercial and industrial zone.  The property immediately became a landmark, owing to its size as much as to the tower that rises from the Operations Building.  The company boasted in 1921 that the 257' tower was the tallest reinforced concrete structure ever built. ",

            "Significance: The Selby Avenue Bridge is significant for its subtle delineation of an exceptional engineering solution to a difficult urban transportation design problem. Selby Avenue intersects the Short Line railroad tracks at an extreme skew. This condition necessitated other than a conventional bridge design to carry the avenue over the tracks. The bridge is also significant as the work of Andreas W. Munster, St. Paul City Bridge Engineer who went on to a prominent career with the Chicago and Great Western Railroad, and for its association with the expanding transportation systems of St. Paul during the period of the city's growth.

            "Significance: Lock and Dam No. 1 is significant because it symbolizes important local and national events and trends, and because it possesses a rare and unique design.  In 1894, Congress authorized two locks and dams for the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and St. Paul due to a rivalry between the two cities and because, at that time, two dams made sense to meet navigation requirements.  National developments in hydropower technology and in the country's attitude toward its natural resources arrested the navigation project in full stride.  Only the power of these developments   on national and local levels   explains whey Congress ordered one of the new locks and dams destroyed and the other revamped.  Those same issues created a decade-long debate so divisive that it immobilized the national government in terms of establishing its role in hydropower development.  Lock and Dam No. 1 represents this debate, as Congress granted the Corps authority to build the hydropower station base but not the plant and as six years would pass before the Ford Motor Company built its plant on this base.  Because Congress revamped the original navigation project to include a high dam and hydropower, the Corps selected an Ambursen dam for Dam No. 1 and modified it in ways that make it a uncommon structure.  In separably intertwined, politics, economics and technological developments explain how Dam No. 1 came to be and why it has a unique design. ",

            "Significance: The Crown Roller Mill is historically significant for its unusual architectural detailing and close association with Minneapolis's \"West Side Milling District.\"  Begun in 1879 and completed in 1880, the Crown was one in a series of flour mills built on the West Side during the 1870s.  The new structure was among the largest of these mills, and one of the first to utilize rollers and the gradual-reduction milling process on a large scale.  While most flour mills were plain, utilitarian structures, the Crown was unique for its full mansard roof, segmental arched windows, ornamental date and name plaque, and other architectural details.  The Crown and other West Side mills helped establish Minneapolis as the flouring capital of the United States from 1880 to 1930.  Due to widespread mill closures in the 1930s, the Crown Roller Mill is currently one of only four West Side flour mills still standing.  In 1971, the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office of the Minnesota Historical Society nominated the structure to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District.

                  "Significance: The significance of the Municipal Hangar was identified in a request for National Register eligibility in 1991.  At that time the Minnesota Historical Society determined the building to be \"eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places as a property associated with the development of the air transportation industry.\"  Only a few airports were established in Minnesota before Wold-Chamberlain in Minneapolis in 1919 and the Saint Paul Airport in 1926.  The hangars built prior to 1927 at Wold-Chamberlain and other airports in the state appear to have been of wood construction, making the Municipal Hangar at the Saint Paul Airport the first steel frame airplane hangar in the state.  Also, according to a survey of state airports in the book \"Minnesota Aviation History: 1857-1845,\" the Municipal Hangar at the Saint Paul Airport appears to be the oldest and most intact airplane hangar in the state.

                  "Significance: This log church was originally called the Muskego Church. It was built in 1843 by Peter Jacobson, to serve an early Norwegian colony in what is now Racine, Wisconsin. It is said to be the first Norwegian Lutheran church in the United States. The building is constructed of hewn red oak logs, hand-adzed, with upper logs cupped over ones below. In 1904, the church was moved to the campus of Luther Theological Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. On its removal here it was encased with wood studs and siding. The interior retains the original log finish. Rev. C. L. Clausen was the first pastor. Records shows 130 members in 1845. ",

                  "Significance: The Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse is a stunning example of innovative public architecture from the American Depression Era.  Commissioned in 1930, and completed in 1931 by Holabird and Root of Chicago and Ellerbe and Company of Saint Paul, the City Hall design uses two Art Deco styles known as \"American Perpendicular\" and \"Zigzag Moderne.\"  The use of Art Deco styles and incorporation of technologically advanced functional features in the new City Hall building make it a distinctively \"modern\" structure in the context of 1930's architecture.  Art works which symbolically depict the progressive ideals of a modern industrial society add to the futuristic image of the architecture.  Because it was constructed of the highest quality materials and is an excellent representative of a past style in the contemporary built environment, the City Hall is still considered an architectural masterpiece and a landmark in the city of Saint Paul.

The house is of particular interest because it has been altered only slightly from its original condition, and has retained almost all of the original furnishings. ",

Constructed shortly after the company's takeover by St. Paul and Minneapolis interests, the building helped establish the Twin Cities as Northwest's center of operations for more than the next half century.  In its materials, structural engineering, and layout, the building was highly representative of American hangar design during the early years of commercial aviation.  As one of the few remaining examples of its type, Northwest Airlines Hangar and Administration Building was declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in the spring of 1988. ",

                  "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are historically significant as the oldest existing railroad complex in Minnesota.  The events leading to the development of railroading in Minnesota and the Northwest; the ambitious career of James J. Hill, the \"Empire Builder\" who founded the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway (now Burlington Northern); and the development of St. Paul as a regional rail and trade center, all focus around the Jackson Street Shops.  The major buildings on the site were built in the 1880s to serve as a base of operations for Hill's railroad and to further his ambitious plans to extend his railroad operations to the West Coast. ",

The shops were built for the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway, precursor of the Great Northern Railway, owned and operated by James J. Hill and are one of the few remaining examples of \"machine shop\" limestone architecture.  The brick chimney served the boiler plant connected to the Machine Shop which provided steam to the original shop complex. ",

                  "Significance: In 1979, the Stockyards Exchange Building, including the 1887 building and the 1912/1917 annex, was determined to be of sufficient national significance to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.  The building was nominated for its association with the development of the St. Paul Stockyards which, in the early 1900's, became \"the United States largest stocker, feeder, and milch cow market...\", and also with the development of meat packing in Minnesota which \"supplied dressed meat to a large part of the world.\"  The Stockyards Exchange Building is also recognized for its local significance of having served the community of South Saint Paul as the first Post Office, first meeting place for the City Council, first bank (Stockyards National Bank), and as a meeting place for community groups.  Although the 1887 building is primarily associated with the beginning of these significant developments, the annex additions were constructed by the original business and were the direct result of the increased growth and success of that business.  The annex allowed the business to grow and expand, while remaining in its original location, at a time when the industry reached its peak of production.  The 1887 building and the annex continued to serve the same business until 1977, when reductions in the industry necessitated moving the business to a new smaller building.  Of secondary significance is the recognition of the 1887 building as a fine local example of late 19th Century commercial architecture in Richardsonian Romanesque style, designed by the local architect C.A. Reed, and the recognition of the annex as an example of early 20th Century office building design.  It is also notable that the Stockyard Company remained in the same location for 90 years and that the interiors are relatively unaltered since their construction. ",

                  "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are the oldest surviving railroad structures in St. Paul and the oldest structures built for the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway Company in Minnesota.  The shops played an important historic role in the development of St. Paul as a transportation center in the upper midwest.  They were further instrumental in the development of the surrounding communities: Frog Town, Railroad Island, Swede Hollow, the North End and Thomas-Dale.  The oil house was a key part in the operation of the facilities at Jackson Street.  It provided for the storage and handling of the various oils used by the engine, car, paint and shop service buildings.  The oil house was among the original buildings constructed in 1882-83 of grey limestone, using state of the art technology the structure was considered to be substantial and would meet the needs of an expanding railroad for years to come.

One of the most dominant landmarks in the City of St. Paul, the structure is a simplified and somewhat severe version of the German Romanesque Revival, and is reported to have been patterned after the famous Ludwigskirche (1829-40) in Munich, designed by Friedrich von Geertner (1792-1847).  A view of this Revival Church can be seen in Henry Russell Hitchcock's \"Architecture, Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\" (Baltimore, Md.: Penguin Books, Inc., 1958), Plate 10B. ",

                  "Significance: The Arlington Avenue Bridge is significant as an early representative example of a prestressed concrete girder bridge in Minnesota. At the time of construction in 1959, prestressed concrete was emerging as a significant technological advancement in bridge design. at this same time, the Minnesota Highway system was under development and a large number of bridges were required to span and carry the new highway in the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area and throughout the state. The availability and economy of prestressed concrete as a bridge building material facilitated the development of the Interstate Highway system in the Twin Cities and throughout the country by providing the main materials for the construction of a large number of similar bridges in a short time at a very competitive cost. The Arlington Avenue Bridge also represents the development of Elk River Concrete, a regional company that collaborated with the Minnesota Highway Department (MHD) and other engineers to develop a system for prestressed concrete beam fabrication that further facilitated the state's bridge construction and Interstate and highway development during this period.

                  "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are a complex of 12 structures.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop was constructed in 1882.  They are gray limestone structures typical of late 19th century \"machine shop\" style industrial buildings.  They are significant as one of St. Paul's oldest known railroad buildings.  They are one of the oldest structures built in Minnesota for James J. Hill's St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company.They are the only surviving buildings from the operating division of the Manitoba Railway.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop are part of the only railroad complex in Minnesota built of stone.  In terms of industry and engineering, they were considered a state-of-the-art facility.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop was designed to function as a major repair facility for freight cars, passenger coaches, and locomotives.  By 1900, the Jackson Street Car Shop and Wood Shop was the Great Northern's major passenger repair facility. ",

                  "Significance: As one of the first Montgomery Ward catalog houses built outside Chicago, the property represents a period of expansion and change in the history of the country's first mail-order house.  Conceived as Ward's northwestern branch, the facility housed only a mail-order operation and its associated administrative offices.  Soon after the branch was established, however, competition forced the company to move into the retail field.  Ward's focus increasingly shifted to retail, and the property underwent substantial alterations to accommodate the change.  Montgomery Ward's decision to locate the branch in the Midway District of Saint Paul reflects that area's emergence as a commercial and industrial zone.  The property immediately became a landmark, owing to its size as much as to the tower that rises from the Operations Building.  The company boasted in 1921 that the 257' tower was the tallest reinforced concrete structure ever built. ",

                  "Significance: The Selby Avenue Bridge is significant for its subtle delineation of an exceptional engineering solution to a difficult urban transportation design problem. Selby Avenue intersects the Short Line railroad tracks at an extreme skew. This condition necessitated other than a conventional bridge design to carry the avenue over the tracks. The bridge is also significant as the work of Andreas W. Munster, St. Paul City Bridge Engineer who went on to a prominent career with the Chicago and Great Western Railroad, and for its association with the expanding transportation systems of St. Paul during the period of the city's growth.

                  "Significance: Lock and Dam No. 1 is significant because it symbolizes important local and national events and trends, and because it possesses a rare and unique design.  In 1894, Congress authorized two locks and dams for the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and St. Paul due to a rivalry between the two cities and because, at that time, two dams made sense to meet navigation requirements.  National developments in hydropower technology and in the country's attitude toward its natural resources arrested the navigation project in full stride.  Only the power of these developments   on national and local levels   explains whey Congress ordered one of the new locks and dams destroyed and the other revamped.  Those same issues created a decade-long debate so divisive that it immobilized the national government in terms of establishing its role in hydropower development.  Lock and Dam No. 1 represents this debate, as Congress granted the Corps authority to build the hydropower station base but not the plant and as six years would pass before the Ford Motor Company built its plant on this base.  Because Congress revamped the original navigation project to include a high dam and hydropower, the Corps selected an Ambursen dam for Dam No. 1 and modified it in ways that make it a uncommon structure.  In separably intertwined, politics, economics and technological developments explain how Dam No. 1 came to be and why it has a unique design. ",

                  "Significance: The Crown Roller Mill is historically significant for its unusual architectural detailing and close association with Minneapolis's \"West Side Milling District.\"  Begun in 1879 and completed in 1880, the Crown was one in a series of flour mills built on the West Side during the 1870s.  The new structure was among the largest of these mills, and one of the first to utilize rollers and the gradual-reduction milling process on a large scale.  While most flour mills were plain, utilitarian structures, the Crown was unique for its full mansard roof, segmental arched windows, ornamental date and name plaque, and other architectural details.  The Crown and other West Side mills helped establish Minneapolis as the flouring capital of the United States from 1880 to 1930.  Due to widespread mill closures in the 1930s, the Crown Roller Mill is currently one of only four West Side flour mills still standing.  In 1971, the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office of the Minnesota Historical Society nominated the structure to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District.

          "Significance: The significance of the Municipal Hangar was identified in a request for National Register eligibility in 1991.  At that time the Minnesota Historical Society determined the building to be \"eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places as a property associated with the development of the air transportation industry.\"  Only a few airports were established in Minnesota before Wold-Chamberlain in Minneapolis in 1919 and the Saint Paul Airport in 1926.  The hangars built prior to 1927 at Wold-Chamberlain and other airports in the state appear to have been of wood construction, making the Municipal Hangar at the Saint Paul Airport the first steel frame airplane hangar in the state.  Also, according to a survey of state airports in the book \"Minnesota Aviation History: 1857-1845,\" the Municipal Hangar at the Saint Paul Airport appears to be the oldest and most intact airplane hangar in the state.

          "Significance: This log church was originally called the Muskego Church. It was built in 1843 by Peter Jacobson, to serve an early Norwegian colony in what is now Racine, Wisconsin. It is said to be the first Norwegian Lutheran church in the United States. The building is constructed of hewn red oak logs, hand-adzed, with upper logs cupped over ones below. In 1904, the church was moved to the campus of Luther Theological Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. On its removal here it was encased with wood studs and siding. The interior retains the original log finish. Rev. C. L. Clausen was the first pastor. Records shows 130 members in 1845. ",

          "Significance: The Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse is a stunning example of innovative public architecture from the American Depression Era.  Commissioned in 1930, and completed in 1931 by Holabird and Root of Chicago and Ellerbe and Company of Saint Paul, the City Hall design uses two Art Deco styles known as \"American Perpendicular\" and \"Zigzag Moderne.\"  The use of Art Deco styles and incorporation of technologically advanced functional features in the new City Hall building make it a distinctively \"modern\" structure in the context of 1930's architecture.  Art works which symbolically depict the progressive ideals of a modern industrial society add to the futuristic image of the architecture.  Because it was constructed of the highest quality materials and is an excellent representative of a past style in the contemporary built environment, the City Hall is still considered an architectural masterpiece and a landmark in the city of Saint Paul.

The house is of particular interest because it has been altered only slightly from its original condition, and has retained almost all of the original furnishings. ",

          "Significance: Northwest Airlines Hangar and Administration Building was the airline's first corporate headquarters expressly built for that purpose.  Constructed shortly after the company's takeover by St. Paul and Minneapolis interests, the building helped establish the Twin Cities as Northwest's center of operations for more than the next half century.  In its materials, structural engineering, and layout, the building was highly representative of American hangar design during the early years of commercial aviation.  As one of the few remaining examples of its type, Northwest Airlines Hangar and Administration Building was declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in the spring of 1988. ",

          "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are historically significant as the oldest existing railroad complex in Minnesota.  The events leading to the development of railroading in Minnesota and the Northwest; the ambitious career of James J. Hill, the \"Empire Builder\" who founded the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway (now Burlington Northern); and the development of St. Paul as a regional rail and trade center, all focus around the Jackson Street Shops.  The major buildings on the site were built in the 1880s to serve as a base of operations for Hill's railroad and to further his ambitious plans to extend his railroad operations to the West Coast. ",

Its Neoclassical appearance is an architectural complement to the main seminary building, Bockman Hall, also designed by Omeyer and Thori and completed in 1902. The house contributes to the National Register-eligible Luther Seminary Upper Campus Historic District. ",

Niemeyer, the Merriam Park Branch Public Library is a fine local example of the Collegiate Gothic style of architecture.  During its 60 years of service, the library became one of the most heavily used branch libraries in Saint Paul.  In recognition of its historical importance, the building was designated \"a site of major significance\" by the Saint Paul Heritage Preservation Commission in 1983. ",

          "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are the oldest standing stone railroad shops in Minnesota.

          "Significance: In 1979, the Stockyards Exchange Building, including the 1887 building and the 1912/1917 annex, was determined to be of sufficient national significance to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.  The building was nominated for its association with the development of the St. Paul Stockyards which, in the early 1900's, became \"the United States largest stocker, feeder, and milch cow market...\", and also with the development of meat packing in Minnesota which \"supplied dressed meat to a large part of the world.\"  The Stockyards Exchange Building is also recognized for its local significance of having served the community of South Saint Paul as the first Post Office, first meeting place for the City Council, first bank (Stockyards National Bank), and as a meeting place for community groups.  Although the 1887 building is primarily associated with the beginning of these significant developments, the annex additions were constructed by the original business and were the direct result of the increased growth and success of that business.  The annex allowed the business to grow and expand, while remaining in its original location, at a time when the industry reached its peak of production.  The 1887 building and the annex continued to serve the same business until 1977, when reductions in the industry necessitated moving the business to a new smaller building.  Of secondary significance is the recognition of the 1887 building as a fine local example of late 19th Century commercial architecture in Richardsonian Romanesque style, designed by the local architect C.A. Reed, and the recognition of the annex as an example of early 20th Century office building design.  It is also notable that the Stockyard Company remained in the same location for 90 years and that the interiors are relatively unaltered since their construction. ",

          "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are the oldest surviving railroad structures in St. Paul and the oldest structures built for the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway Company in Minnesota.  The shops played an important historic role in the development of St. Paul as a transportation center in the upper midwest.  They were further instrumental in the development of the surrounding communities: Frog Town, Railroad Island, Swede Hollow, the North End and Thomas-Dale.  The oil house was a key part in the operation of the facilities at Jackson Street.  It provided for the storage and handling of the various oils used by the engine, car, paint and shop service buildings.  The oil house was among the original buildings constructed in 1882-83 of grey limestone, using state of the art technology the structure was considered to be substantial and would meet the needs of an expanding railroad for years to come.

Hill's Great Northern Railroad.  As a group, they are the city's oldest known railroad shop complex.

          "Significance: The Church of the Assumption was designed by Joseph Reidl (Reidel), Court Architect of the Bavarian ruling family, the Wittelsbechs.  One of the most dominant landmarks in the City of St. Paul, the structure is a simplified and somewhat severe version of the German Romanesque Revival, and is reported to have been patterned after the famous Ludwigskirche (1829-40) in Munich, designed by Friedrich von Geertner (1792-1847).  A view of this Revival Church can be seen in Henry Russell Hitchcock's \"Architecture, Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\" (Baltimore, Md.: Penguin Books, Inc., 1958), Plate 10B. ",

          "Significance: The Arlington Avenue Bridge is significant as an early representative example of a prestressed concrete girder bridge in Minnesota. At the time of construction in 1959, prestressed concrete was emerging as a significant technological advancement in bridge design. at this same time, the Minnesota Highway system was under development and a large number of bridges were required to span and carry the new highway in the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area and throughout the state. The availability and economy of prestressed concrete as a bridge building material facilitated the development of the Interstate Highway system in the Twin Cities and throughout the country by providing the main materials for the construction of a large number of similar bridges in a short time at a very competitive cost. The Arlington Avenue Bridge also represents the development of Elk River Concrete, a regional company that collaborated with the Minnesota Highway Department (MHD) and other engineers to develop a system for prestressed concrete beam fabrication that further facilitated the state's bridge construction and Interstate and highway development during this period.

          "Significance: The Jackson Street Shops are a complex of 12 structures.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop was constructed in 1882.  They are gray limestone structures typical of late 19th century \"machine shop\" style industrial buildings.  They are significant as one of St. Paul's oldest known railroad buildings.  They are one of the oldest structures built in Minnesota for James J. Hill's St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company.They are the only surviving buildings from the operating division of the Manitoba Railway.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop are part of the only railroad complex in Minnesota built of stone.  In terms of industry and engineering, they were considered a state-of-the-art facility.  The Car Shop and Wood Shop was designed to function as a major repair facility for freight cars, passenger coaches, and locomotives.  By 1900, the Jackson Street Car Shop and Wood Shop was the Great Northern's major passenger repair facility. ",

          "Significance: As one of the first Montgomery Ward catalog houses built outside Chicago, the property represents a period of expansion and change in the history of the country's first mail-order house.  Conceived as Ward's northwestern branch, the facility housed only a mail-order operation and its associated administrative offices.  Soon after the branch was established, however, competition forced the company to move into the retail field.  Ward's focus increasingly shifted to retail, and the property underwent substantial alterations to accommodate the change.  Montgomery Ward's decision to locate the branch in the Midway District of Saint Paul reflects that area's emergence as a commercial and industrial zone.  The property immediately became a landmark, owing to its size as much as to the tower that rises from the Operations Building.  The company boasted in 1921 that the 257' tower was the tallest reinforced concrete structure ever built. ",

          "Significance: The Selby Avenue Bridge is significant for its subtle delineation of an exceptional engineering solution to a difficult urban transportation design problem. Selby Avenue intersects the Short Line railroad tracks at an extreme skew. This condition necessitated other than a conventional bridge design to carry the avenue over the tracks. The bridge is also significant as the work of Andreas W. Munster, St. Paul City Bridge Engineer who went on to a prominent career with the Chicago and Great Western Railroad, and for its association with the expanding transportation systems of St. Paul during the period of the city's growth.

          "Significance: Lock and Dam No. 1 is significant because it symbolizes important local and national events and trends, and because it possesses a rare and unique design.  In 1894, Congress authorized two locks and dams for the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and St. Paul due to a rivalry between the two cities and because, at that time, two dams made sense to meet navigation requirements.  National developments in hydropower technology and in the country's attitude toward its natural resources arrested the navigation project in full stride.  Only the power of these developments   on national and local levels   explains whey Congress ordered one of the new locks and dams destroyed and the other revamped.  Those same issues created a decade-long debate so divisive that it immobilized the national government in terms of establishing its role in hydropower development.  Lock and Dam No. 1 represents this debate, as Congress granted the Corps authority to build the hydropower station base but not the plant and as six years would pass before the Ford Motor Company built its plant on this base.  Because Congress revamped the original navigation project to include a high dam and hydropower, the Corps selected an Ambursen dam for Dam No. 1 and modified it in ways that make it a uncommon structure.  In separably intertwined, politics, economics and technological developments explain how Dam No. 1 came to be and why it has a unique design. ",

          "Significance: The Crown Roller Mill is historically significant for its unusual architectural detailing and close association with Minneapolis's \"West Side Milling District.\"  Begun in 1879 and completed in 1880, the Crown was one in a series of flour mills built on the West Side during the 1870s.  The new structure was among the largest of these mills, and one of the first to utilize rollers and the gradual-reduction milling process on a large scale.  While most flour mills were plain, utilitarian structures, the Crown was unique for its full mansard roof, segmental arched windows, ornamental date and name plaque, and other architectural details.  The Crown and other West Side mills helped establish Minneapolis as the flouring capital of the United States from 1880 to 1930.  Due to widespread mill closures in the 1930s, the Crown Roller Mill is currently one of only four West Side flour mills still standing.  In 1971, the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office of the Minnesota Historical Society nominated the structure to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District.

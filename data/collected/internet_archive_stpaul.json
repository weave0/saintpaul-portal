The teams worked with two mentors (an expert practitioner and a graduate student) to develop a strategic plan for initiating or continuing the development of an integrated tech prep program within urban schools. The planning documents for integrated tech prep programs at high schools and community colleges serving the following major cities are included: Washington, D.C.; Cleveland, Ohio; Las Cruces, New Mexico; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Detroit, Michigan; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Baltimore, Maryland.

The work will be completed over a four week period. City residents are advised to take notice of temporary parking restrictions on their streets.
